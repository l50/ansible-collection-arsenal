# Initializes VNC server session with a unique, random password for each user
# on a system. Calculates a distinct VNC port based on the user's UID to
# avoid port collisions among multiple users. Provides isolated VNC sessions
# for each user, ensuring secure access.
#
# Usage:
#   start_vnc
#
# Behavior:
#   Generates a random 8-character password and starts a VNC server on a
#   unique port for the user.
#
# Example:
#   start_vnc (Execute within user's container environment)
#
# Note:
#   Requires VNC server binaries and user-specific .vnc directories set up.
start_vnc() {
    # Determine unique VNC port number based on UID
    local user_id="$(id -u)"
    local vnc_port=$((5900 + user_id % 1000))

    # Create random 8 character VNC password
    local vnc_pwd="$(head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 8)"

    # Set the random 8 character VNC password
    echo "${vnc_pwd}" | {{ vnc_setup_vncpwd_path }} -f > "$HOME/.vnc/passwd"

    # Start vncserver on the calculated port
    /usr/bin/vncserver :${vnc_port} {{ vnc_setup_client_options }}
}
